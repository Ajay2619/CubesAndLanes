Hey Hi,
So as mentioned in the [task]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jR4MhXjr3PHbcGeEXyAEUMz3FMlh8ZUL/view?usp=sharing)), I've implemented the player which can move without any input from the user. So we dont need to do anything as of now except watching the cube dodging through all the enemies seamlessly.
I hope I've built what you wanted met the expectations and please let me know if there is any mistake or misunderstanding.
Thank you.
